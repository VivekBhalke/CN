flags -> status of the network.
inet -> ipv4 of this machine , 
netmask -> range of ip address in the neighbourhood , 
	like 225.225.248 means that , it is a big number so large no of devices are in the negibourhood

brodcast -> when we send message to this address , then it sends to all the pc which are in the network.

inet6 -> computers ipv6 address , 
ether -> computers MAC address.

RX packets — how many packets (small pieces of data) your computer has received.

TX packets — how many packets your computer has sent.

MTU — the biggest size of a data packet your network can send at once.

flags — tells if your network is on, working, supports broadcasting, etc.


lo -> loopback address -> localhost
